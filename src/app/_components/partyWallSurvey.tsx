                        <p className="mb-4">A Party Wall Survey is needed if your neighbour disputes or ignores your Party Wall notice.</p>
                        <p className="mb-4">If you canâ€™t agree on the proposed works for the party wall, then the surveyor will inspect the situation and review the work required. They will then be able to draw up a Party Wall Agreement to resolve the issues.</p>
                        <p className="mb-4">Compare My Move have a network of local Party Wall Surveyors to help resolve your party wall issues. Get connected with up to 6 RICS or RPSA surveyors to help save on your surveying costs.</p>
